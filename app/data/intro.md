We are the Programming, Education, and Computer-Human Interaction (PEACH) Lab, a young and passionate research group led by [Prof. April Wang](https://aprilwang.me/). 
We are part of the [Institute for Intelligent Interactive Systems](https://iis.inf.ethz.ch/) at the [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), and are affiliated with the [ACM SwissCHI](https://swisschi.acm.org/), [HCI@ETH](https://hci.ethz.ch/), the [Center for Computer Science Education (ABZ)](https://abz.inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich - EPFL Joint Doctoral Program in the Learning Sciences](https://lse.ethz.ch/doctoral-program-in-learning-sciences.html), the [ETH AI Center](https://ai.ethz.ch/), and the [Max Planck ETH Center for Learning Systems (CLS)](https://learning-systems.org/).

Our research focuses on designing interactive and intelligent learning environments to make computer science education experiential. 
Specifically, we ask ourselves what CS education means in the era of AI. 
We believe that CS education goes beyond teaching programming -- it includes AI literacy, computational thinking, and problem-solving skills that are essential for everyone in today's world.
To support this vision, we explore novel interface and interaction designs—from interactive coding notebooks and program visualizations to situated learning tools and social learning interfaces—to transform CS education into an active, engaging, and exploratory experience.
